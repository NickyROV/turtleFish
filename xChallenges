#Further challenges
#Upgrade 1 : Acknowledge signal from underwater unit once communication establish
#Upgrade 1a : Keep track of connection status via IWDG
#Upgrade 2 : Time delay until ESC pick up 1500us signal to set-up thrusters (1 seconds should be good)
#Upgrade 3 : Program to handle situation when two touch buttons fire at the same time, interrupt may be an idea
#Upgrade 3A : Using multi-threading alongside with interrupt to maintain the system concurrently 
#Upgrade 4 : Water lead sensor in underwater unit
#Upgrade 5 : Power Outage sensor in underwater unit
#Upgrade 6 : Crash avoidence by ultrasonic sensor
#Upgrade 7 : More sensors and with PID path control, ROS is definitely a good choose.
#Upgrade 8 : Vision recognition by (possibly...) OpenCV, Scikit-Image, scipy.ndimage and pixel manipulation by NumPy. Newcommer tinyML shows promising future. 
#Upgrade 8A : Image recognition on ARM-base microcontroller, such as TinyML 
#Upgrade 8B : Autonomous drive by Trajectory-Planning algorithm
#Upgrade 9 : System upgrade
#Upgrade 9A : Hardware to support ROS  
#Upgrade 9B : System management by RTOS

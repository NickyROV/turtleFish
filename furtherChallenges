#Further challenges
#Upgrade 1 : Acknowledge signal from underwater unit once communication establish
#Upgrade 1a : Keep track of connection status via IWDG
#Upgrade 2 : Time delay until ESC pick up 1500us signal to set-up thrusters (1 seconds should be good)
#Upgrade 3 : Program to handle situation when two touch buttons fire at the same time, interrupt may be an idea
#Upgrade 4 : Water lead sensor in underwater unit
#Upgrade 5 : Power Outage sensor in underwater unit
#Upgrade 6 : Crash avoidence by ultrasonic sensor
#Upgrade 7 : Vision recognition by Edge AI
#Upgrade 8 : Autonomous drive by Edga AI
#Upgrade 9 : More sensors and with PID path control, ROS is definitely the choose.
